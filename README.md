# green-commute

To create an intelligent system that optimizes daily work commutes by suggesting eco-friendly routes and alternatives based on real-time data, we can utilize various APIs and libraries in Python. Here's a complete Python program that demonstrates how to build such a system using OpenWeatherMap for weather conditions, Google Maps for routing, and some predefined preferences for eco-friendly transportation options.

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install requests googlemaps
```

You will also need to sign up for API keys for both the Google Maps and OpenWeatherMap services.

```python
import requests
import googlemaps
from datetime import datetime
import os

# Set up your API keys as environment variables or directly in the code
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY = os.getenv('GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY', 'YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY')
OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_API_KEY = os.getenv('OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_API_KEY', 'YOUR_OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_API_KEY')

def get_weather_data(api_key, city_name):
    """Fetch weather data from OpenWeatherMap API."""
    base_url = "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?"
    try:
        params = {'q': city_name, 'appid': api_key, 'units': 'metric'}
        response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for HTTP errors
        return response.json()
    except requests.RequestException as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while fetching weather data: {e}")
        return None

def get_eco_friendly_routes(gmaps, start_location, end_location):
    """Fetch eco-friendly routes using Google Maps Directions API."""
    try:
        directions_result = gmaps.directions(
            start_location,
            end_location,
            mode="transit",
            departure_time=datetime.now()
        )
        return directions_result
    except googlemaps.exceptions.ApiError as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while fetching directions: {e}")
        return None

def main():
    # Initialize Google Maps client
    gmaps = googlemaps.Client(key=GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY)

    # Define start and end locations
    start_location = "Your Start Location"
    end_location = "Your End Location"

    # Get weather data
    city_name = "Your City Name"
    weather_data = get_weather_data(OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_API_KEY, city_name)
    if weather_data:
        print(f"Weather in {city_name}: {weather_data['weather'][0]['description']}, {weather_data['main']['temp']}Â°C")

    # Get eco-friendly routes
    routes = get_eco_friendly_routes(gmaps, start_location, end_location)
    if routes:
        for i, route in enumerate(routes):
            print(f"Route {i + 1}:")
            for step in route['legs'][0]['steps']:
                print(step['html_instructions'])
                print(f"Travel mode: {step['travel_mode']}")
                print(f"Duration: {step['duration']['text']}")
            print("\n")
    else:
        print("No routes found.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Key Points:
- The program first fetches real-time weather data for the city where the commute starts, which could be used to decide the best transportation mode (e.g., biking may not be suitable in inclement weather).
- It uses the Google Maps Directions API to retrieve route information while selecting eco-friendly modes of transportation like walking or public transit.
- Error handling is included for network requests to handle situations like invalid API responses or connection issues.

Ensure you replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` and `YOUR_OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_API_KEY` with your actual API keys. Also, replace `"Your Start Location"`, `"Your End Location"`, and `"Your City Name"` with real values before running the program.

Note: You may need additional permissions to use some API features, and possible API usage costs should be considered when deploying a production-level application.
